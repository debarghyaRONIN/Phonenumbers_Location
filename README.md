# Phonenumbers_Location
Two python files, one has the main code connecting the api to find the location, another holds the phone number of the phone which we are trying to find the location of. To use this, In the key section, you have to get a OpenCage Geocoding Api Key which is a paid api key. They also provide a free key to everyone for testing and after sometime, you need to use the paid one.
Thank you.
